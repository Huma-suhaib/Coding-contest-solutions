# Leetcode-weekly-contest
In this this repository I'm uploading the solutions to the coding contests that I give on Leetcode, Hackerrank or GFG. I'm give the contest to prepare my self for coding tests and DSA rounds for placements. Contests are a very good source of learning about new coding concepts, make new connections, learning time management and overcoming failure.
