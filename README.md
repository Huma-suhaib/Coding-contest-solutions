# Leetcode-weekly-contest
In this this repository I'll upload the solutions of my weekly coding contest that I'll give on Leetcode. I'm giving the contest to prepare my self for coding tests and DSA rounds for placements. Contests are a very good source of learning about new coding concepts, make new connections, learning time management and overcoming failure.
